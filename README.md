# Real-Time Sign Language Recognition System

This project aims to develop a real-time sign language recognition system using AI and computer vision techniques. It focuses on Indian Sign Language (ISL) and enables dynamic hand gesture recognition through a webcam or video input.

## 🧠 Features

- Real-time detection and classification of sign language gestures
- Indian Sign Language (ISL) focused
- Deep learning model using YOLOv8 or custom CNN
- Webcam/video feed integration
- Display predicted sign on the screen
- Optional: Text-to-speech or speech output

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenCV
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- Tkinter (for GUI, optional)
- PyTorch
- NumPy, Pandas, etc.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sign-language-recognition.git
   cd sign-language-recognition
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## 📊 Dataset

* Indian Sign Language Dataset (image/video-based)
* Optionally create your own custom dataset using webcam

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* Multi-hand detection
* Sign sentence prediction
* Mobile app deployment
* Translation to other languages
